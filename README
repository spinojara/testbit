testbit
=======
A test server for bitbit.

Building testbit
----------------
Run

	$ make

in the root directory. If the server is desired, it can be compiled by issuing

	$ make everything

instead.


Installing testbit
------------------
testbitd and testbitn need a user called "testbit" to be present. On Linux it
is preferably created by

	# useradd --system                 \
                  --no-create-home         \
		  --comment "testbit user" \
		  --home-dir /dev/null     \
		  --shell /sbin/nologin    \
		  testbit

In addition testbitd needs testbit to have a password as this will be used for
authentication. Create it using

	# passwd testbit

If testbitn is run as a daemon it needs the file /etc/testbit.conf containing
a single integer of cpu cores to use.
