TODO
- Add checks for recvf and sendf in testbit. The program should properly handle
  a loss of connection.
- Sort the different logs correctly. I.e. "done" should be sorted by donetime,
  not queuetime.
- Disable core boost during testing for more stable results. This can be found
  in /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo for intel cpus, and
  in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpux/cpufreq/boost for amd cpus.
